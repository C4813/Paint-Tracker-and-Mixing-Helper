msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Paint Tracker and Mixing Helper helps you keep a structured list of your "
"miniature paints, track which ones you currently own, link each paint to "
"useful resources, and provide interactive colour tools on the front end."
msgstr ""

msgid "How the data is stored"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The plugin adds a custom post type called “Paint Colours” and a taxonomy "
"called “Paint Ranges”."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"each paint has a name (title), a paint number, a hex colour, an “On the "
"shelf” flag, and optional links (tutorials, reviews, example builds, etc.)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"group paints into ranges such as Vallejo Model Color, Vallejo Game Color, "
"and so on."
msgstr ""

msgid "Shortcodes"
msgstr ""

msgid "[paint_table]"
msgstr ""

msgid "Displays a table of paints, optionally filtered to a single paint range."
msgstr ""

msgid "Attributes:"

msgid "Paint table display"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use the option below to choose whether the paint table shows small colour "
"dots (swatches) or highlights the entire row with the paint colour."
msgstr ""

msgid "Show colour dots (swatch column)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Highlight the entire row with the paint colour"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Row highlighting applies the paint colour to the whole row and adjusts text "
"to light/dark for readability."
msgstr ""

msgid "[mixing-helper]"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Shows the two-paint mixing tool. You can pick two paints, set how many "
"parts of each to mix, and see the resulting colour and hex value."

"Each paint dropdown can be filtered by range so you can quickly find the "
"colours you want to mix."
msgstr ""

msgid "[shade-helper]"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Shows the shade helper as a standalone tool. Choose a paint and the plugin "
"will look for the darkest and lightest paints in the same range, then build "
"a small ladder of lighter and darker mixes using those anchor colours."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a visitor arrives from the paint table by clicking a swatch or row, the "
"shade helper can start with that colour already selected."
msgstr ""

msgid "Shading page URL"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This setting tells the plugin where your Shade helper page lives. It should "
"be the URL of the page where you are using the [shade-helper] shortcode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When this URL is set, the colour swatches (or highlighted rows, if you use "
"row mode) in your [paint_table] output become links. Clicking them will take "
"the visitor to your Shade helper page and automatically pass the clicked "
"colour so that the ladder is built around that paint."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you leave this field empty, the swatches/rows remain as simple colour "
"indicators and are not clickable."
msgstr ""

msgid "Enter the URL of the page where you are using the [shade-helper] shortcode."
